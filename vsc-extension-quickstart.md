# Welcome to Your VS Code Extension with Torque Dark Theme

## What's in the Folder

- This folder contains all of the files necessary for your Torque Dark Theme
  extension.
- `package.json` - This is the manifest file that defines the location of the
  theme file and specifies the base theme of the extension.
- `themes/Torque-color-theme.json` - The color theme definition file for Torque
  Dark Theme.

## Get Up and Running Straight Away

- Press `F5` to open a new window with your Torque Dark Theme extension loaded.
- Open `File > Preferences > Color Themes` and pick **Torque Dark Theme**.
- Open a file that has a language associated. The languages' configured grammar
  will tokenize the text and assign 'scopes' to the tokens. To examine these
  scopes, invoke the `Developer: Inspect Editor Tokens and Scopes` command from
  the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P` on Mac).

## Make Changes

- Changes to the theme file (`Torque-color-theme.json`) are automatically
  applied to the Extension Development Host window.

## Adopt Your Theme to Visual Studio Code

- The token colorization is done based on standard TextMate themes. Colors are
  matched against one or more scopes to provide a cohesive coding experience.

To learn more about scopes and how they're used, check out the
[Color Theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/extension-guides/color-theme)
documentation.

## Install Your Extension

- To start using Torque Dark Theme with Visual Studio Code, copy it into the
  `<user home>/.vscode/extensions` folder and restart VS Code.
- To share your extension with the world, read more on
  [Publishing an Extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs) to learn about
  publishing it to the VS Code marketplace.

**Enjoy using Torque Dark Theme!**
